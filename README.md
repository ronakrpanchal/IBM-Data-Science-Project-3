## Introduction
This project analyzes automobile sales data during a recession period. The analysis is performed using Python, with the data visualized on a map to show the distribution of sales across different cities. The project utilizes several data analysis and visualization libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Folium.

Additionally, We create a dashboard using libraries such as dash and plotly.
